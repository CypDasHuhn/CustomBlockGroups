# Help messages
cbg.help.general=<bold><gold>General Usage\n<reset><green>To use Custom Block Groups, you need to\ncreate new group using the <light_purple>"cbg create"<green> command.\nFor the group to be usable, the server needs to \nreload/restart after a change.\nIf you for example want to use the groups in world edit, try out \n"<light_purple>//set ##{0}:[group_name]<green>"\nFor more info how the current and \nregistered state of a group is, \nuse the <light_purple> "cbg info"<green>command, or the interface, \nwhich you can access under the <light_purple>"cbg interface"<green> command. \nTo delete or modify an existing group, \nuse the <light_purple>"cbg [edit/delete]"<green> command.
cbg.help.interface=<bold><gold>Interface Usage\n<reset><green>To use the interface, you need to open it with the <light_purple>"cbg interface"<green> command. The Interface is a way to see & modify existing groups. \nFrom then on you can change your scope, your grouping-setting or just directly click on a group.\nFrom then on, you can modify it using the Edit Items button, \nand just directly change the inventory. Remember to save!
cbg.help.world=<bold><gold>World Usage\n<reset><green>After typing <light_purple>"cbg<green>", enter a "<gold>-<green>", to access the world modifier. \nEither type global / current, or a particular world name. \nYou can chain multiple words by seperating them with a "<gold>,<green>". \nThis will change the scope of the next commands you enter.
cbg.help.admin=<bold><gold>Admin Usage\n<reset><green>To change the datapack name, go into the plugin folder called "<gold>CustomBlockGroups<green>", and go into the "<gold>config.yml<green>" file. \nFind the line with the key "<gold>datapackName<green>", and change the value to your datapack name. \nOn your way you can also change the default world-scope, if you want. If you disable "<gold>globalAsDefault<green>", the default scope will be the current world of the player.\nThen save the file and restart the server. The command permissions are: \n<light_purple>"cbg_create"<green>, <light_purple>"cbg_delete"<green>, <light_purple>"cbg_edit"<green>, <light_purple>"cbg_see"<green>, <light_purple>"cbg_help_admin"<green>.\nBy default see is for everyone and the rest are locked for Operators. \nUse a Permission Manager Plugin like "<gold>LuckPerms<green>" to change these.
